# Despite being over a decade old, matplotlib is still the most widely used library for plotting in the Python community. It was designed to closely resemble MATLAB, a proprietary programming language developed in the 1980s. Because matplotlib was the first Python data visualization library, many other libraries are built on top of it or designed to work in tandem with it during analysis. Some libraries like pandas and Seaborn are “wrappers” over matplotlib. They allow you to access a number of matplotlib’s methods with less code.
